# What's a TUI???

- Interactive Terminal Application
- Runs in your Terminal
- Contains some kind of render loop to refresh the page
- Allows for interactions through keyboard and/or mouse.
- Example Applications
  - [Lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) - Git Workflows
  - [Lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker) - Docker Management
  - [Posting](https://github.com/darrenburns/posting) - Postman Alternative

# The Basics: Understanding The Model

```go
type Model interface {
	// Init is the first function that will be called. It returns an optional
	// initial command. To not perform an initial command return nil.
	Init() Cmd

	// Update is called when a message is received. Use it to inspect messages
	// and, in response, update the model and/or send a command.
	Update(Msg) (Model, Cmd)

	// View renders the program's UI, which is just a string. The view is
	// rendered after every Update.
	View() string
}
```

<br/>

This is the core type that you'll use to create your interactive elements

---

# The Basics: The Render Loop

<img src="/images/renderloop.png"/>

---
---

# The Basics: Commands and Messages

```go
// Cmd is an IO operation that returns a message when it's complete. If it's
// nil it's considered a no-op. Use it for things like HTTP requests, timers,
// saving and loading from disk, and so on.
//
// Note that there's almost never a reason to use a command to send a message
// to another part of your program. That can almost always be done in the
// update function.
type Cmd func() Msg

// Msg contain data from the result of a IO operation. Msgs trigger the update
// function and, henceforth, the UI.
type Msg interface{}
```

<br/>

`Cmd` and `Msg` are the core types to create and dispatch events within the _"Loop"_

# The Basics: Running The Model

````md magic-move {lines: true}
```go
func TUI(ctx context.Context) error {
	p := tea.NewProgram(pages.NewLayout(), tea.WithAltScreen())
	if _, err := p.Run(); err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Alas, there's been an error: %v", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
	return nil
}
```

```go {2}
func TUI(ctx context.Context) error {
	p := tea.NewProgram(pages.NewLayout(), tea.WithAltScreen())
	if _, err := p.Run(); err != nil {
		fmt.Printf("Alas, there's been an error: %v", err)
		os.Exit(1)
	}
	return nil
}
```

````

<br/>

- `tea.NewProgram` takes in a `Model` interface and starts the rendering loop.
- `tea.WithAltScreen()` runs the application in 'take over mode' - it will take up the whole terminal screen.
